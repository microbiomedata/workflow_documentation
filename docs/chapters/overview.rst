Overview
==================

NMDC
----
The National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) is a new initiative, launched in July 2019 and funded by the Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research program, that aims to empower the research community to more effectively harness microbiome data. The NMDC is building an open-source, integrated data science ecosystem aimed at leveraging existing efforts in the microbiome research space, including data standards, quality, integration, and access, to create a linked data discovery portal. Read the Nature Reviews Microbiology Comment on the NMDC or visit microbiomedata.org.

NMDC Workflows
--------------

The NMDC workflows are also available as a web application. NMDC EDGE takes an updated EDGE Bioinformatics framework and has only the NMDC workflows integrated in order to make these workflows accessible in a user-friendly interface. (A brief introduction to EDGE Bioinformatics is found in the EDGE ABCs.) NMDC EDGE is provided as a webservice especially for users who are not comfortable with running command line tools or without the computational resources to run the command line versions.
 

The NMDC EDGE web application is available at: https://nmdc.edge-bioinformatics-test.org


Execution Evironment
--------------------
Two common ways to install and run the NMDC workflows:

- Native installation
- Containers

TODO: The following ways to run the workflows have to be separate out from public release of the documentation.

- Cori/NERSC
- LANL enviroment
- KBase (TODO: ?)


General Guidelines
------------------
TODO: Can be from Shane's "do's and dont's" document.

Open source software, FAIR,

TODO: shall we mentions the following line?
all commercial software are optional alternatives and not required.
