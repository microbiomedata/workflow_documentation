Overview
==================

NMDC
----
The National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) is a new initiative, launched in July 2019 and funded by the Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research program, that aims to empower the research community to more effectively harness microbiome data. The NMDC is building an open-source, integrated data science ecosystem aimed at leveraging existing efforts in the microbiome research space, including data standards, quality, integration, and access, to create a linked data discovery portal. Read the `Nature Reviews Microbiology Comment <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0377-0>`_ on the NMDC or visit the `NMDC website <https://microbiomedata.org/>`_.

Four national laboratories are working together to produce the NMDC:

 - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
 - Los Alamos National Laboratory
 - Oak Ridge National Laboratory
 - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory


NMDC Workflows
--------------

General Guidelines
--------------------

NMDC aims to integrate existing open-source bioinformatics tools into standardized workflows for processing raw multi-omics data to produce interoperable and reusable annotated data products. Any commercial software are optional alternatives and not required.

Execution Evironment
--------------------

Two common ways to install and run the NMDC workflows:

 - Native installation
 - Containers

The NMDC workflows have been written in WDL and require a WDL-capable Workflow Execution Tool (i.e., Cromwell). To ease the native installation, Docker images have been created for the third-party tools for all of the workflows as well. The workflows use the corresponding Docker images to run the required third-party tools. Databases must be downloaded and installed for most of the workflows.
 

The NMDC workflows are also available as a web application called `NMDC EDGE <https://nmdc-edge.org/home>`_ . The application has only the NMDC workflows integrated into an updated framework for `EDGE Bioinformatics <https://edgebioinformatics.org/>`_ ; this provides the workflows, third-party software, and requisite databases within a platform with a user-friendly interface. NMDC EDGE is provided as a web application especially for users who are not comfortable with running command line tools or without the computational resources to run the command line/ Docker versions.
