Metagenome Annotation Workflow
==============================

Summary
-------

This workflow is based on the JGI/IMG metagenome annotation pipeline.
It takes assembled metagenomes and generates structrual and functional annotations.  The workflow splits the input assembly
into 10MB shards and proccesses those in parallel.  The workflow uses a number of open-source tools and databases to generate the structural
and functional annotations.

Details
---------------------
The annotation workflow is based on the IMG annotation workflow.  The input assembly
is first split into 10MB chunks.  Depending on the workflow engine configuration,
the in splits can be processed in parallel.  Each split is first structurally annotated,
then then those results are used for the functional annotation.  The structural annotation
uses tRNAscan_se, RFAM, CRT, Prodigal and GeneMarkS.  These results are merged to create
a concensus structural annotation.  The resulting GFF is used in the functional annootation
which uses multiple protein family databases (SMART, COG, TIGRFAM, SUPERFAMILY, Pfam and 
Cath-FunFam) along with custom HMM models to generate the functional annotations.  These 
predictions are done using Last and HMM.  These annotations are merged into a consensus 
GFF file.  Finally, the split annotations are merged together to generate a single structural
anotation file and single functional annotation file.  In addition, several summary files
are generated in TSV format.
